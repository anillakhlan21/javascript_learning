## A closure in JavaScript is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer (enclosing) function's scope, and the global scope. Closures allow you to define functions with behavior that depends on values that are not passed as arguments, effectively "remembering" the environment in which they were created.

## Closures are created when a nested function references variables from its containing (parent) function

## Closures are an essential concept in JavaScript and are used in various programming patterns, such as callbacks, higher-order functions, and module patterns. They help you create functions with private state and control access to variables, improving code modularity and maintainability.
