# Error handling is an important aspect of programming, as it allows you to handle exceptional 
situations gracefully and ensure that your application continues to function correctly. 
In JavaScript, you can use the try, catch, and throw statements for error handling.

## try: The try statement is used to wrap a block of code that might throw an exception (i.e., produce an error). If an error occurs within the try block, the code execution jumps to the corresponding catch block.

## catch: The catch statement is used to define a block of code that will be executed if an exception is thrown in the associated try block. The catch block receives an error object, which you can use to get information about the error and handle it accordingly.

## throw: The throw statement is used to create custom exceptions. You can throw a custom error message, an object, or an instance of the built-in Error object or its subclasses (e.g., TypeError, RangeError, etc.).
