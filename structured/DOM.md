DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation is the process of using JavaScript to interact with and modify the structure, content, and styling of an HTML document. This is a powerful feature that allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

Here's an explanation of various DOM manipulation techniques in JavaScript, along with examples:

# Selecting elements: The first step in DOM manipulation is selecting the elements you want to work with. You can use several methods to select elements, such as getElementById, querySelector, and querySelectorAll.

# Modifying content: You can modify the content of an element using its textContent or innerHTML property.

# Changing attributes: You can modify an element's attributes using the setAttribute() method, or by directly accessing the attribute property.

# Adding and removing classes: You can add or remove CSS classes to an element using the classList property, which provides methods like add(), remove(), and toggle().
